# ⚜️ Ye Olde AI Scribe - My "Was Bored" Project 📜🤪

Hey, Tanmay Goel here. So, I was mega bored, probably avoiding "real work" (you know how it is), and decided to see if I could slap together this AI chat thing with different historical personas in like, under an hour. Just for kicks, really.

Honestly, didn't expect much, but it turned out... kinda neat? Better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick, anyway. So, here it is. The code's all open for you to poke around. Try it yourself, I guess!

(Ah, why am I doing this? Tanmay, go do *real work*. Stop building these dumb wrappers... hmm, this one's actually kinda smart though, not gonna lie. Lessgo!)

---

**Quick Start if you *really* wanna try it:**
1.  Fork/Clone.
2.  Get a Google Gemini API key.
3.  Deploy to Vercel (or similar). Set `GOOGLE_API_KEY` as an environment variable. Make sure Vercel can find `@google/generative-ai` for the backend.
4.  Chat with history. Or don't. Whatever.
